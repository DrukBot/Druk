# Druk


Druk is an open-source Discord bot made in Python.
It was initialy meant to be an entry for a bot jam, but we, the devs, decided to continue the bot's development.

## Running the bot.

- You can run Druk on your own by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt && python3 -m main
```
